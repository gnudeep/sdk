 * _instance name: The target instance to which the autoscale policies should be applied._
 
 ###### Flags (Optional):

    cellery apply-policy autoscale myscalepolicy.yaml myinstance --gateway
    cellery apply-policy autoscale myscalepolicy.yaml myinstance
  ```
  
 ###### Sample autoscale policy:
  ```yaml
    type: AutoscalePolicy
    rules:
    - overridable: true
      policy:
        maxReplicas: 4
        metrics:
        - resource:
            name: cpu
            targetAverageUtilization: 40
          type: Resource
        minReplicas: "1"
      target:
        name: controller
        type: component
    ---
    type: AutoscalePolicy
    rules:
      - overridable: false
        policy:
          maxReplicas: 2
          metrics:
            - resource:
                name: cpu
                targetAverageUtilization: 50
              type: Resource
          minReplicas: "1"
        target:
          type: gateway
    ---
  ```
  * If the target type is specified as 'component', that implies that the policy should be applied to the component denoted by the target name.
  * If the target type is 'gateway' it should be applied to the gateway of the relevant cell instance.
  * The flag 'overridable' implies whether the existing policy can be overriden by the same command repeatedly.
